## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

The biggest takeaway from this assignment was trying to get my playwright to work properly before even starting. I had to play around in Visual Studio Code to make sure that my python interpreter was configured to use pytest for testing and not unittest, which wouldn't run the tests in the tests folder under the assignment project root. It taught me how to better navigate Visual Studio Code and the search bar above, and I learned to use Command + Shift + P as a shortcut for the search bar.
In terms of scraping, this assignment helped me review figuring out which CSS selectors to use based on what's in the "inspect" HTML. I am still not great at identifying when to use which selector, but in this case it was the "next line" "~*" query selector for scraping the title text.
I had to look at the solutions much less during this assignment than during previous ones, and the documentation was helpful. I remember playing around with the "inspect" feature on webpages when I was in elementary school and changing colors and words on the page, so it's cool for that to have a use now for me.
